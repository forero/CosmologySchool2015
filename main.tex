\begin{abstract}
This document summarizes the proposal to invite Prof. Yehuda Hoffman
and Stefan Gottloeber for a joint visit during June 2015 sponsored by the
Sanford Chair funds.  The main results of this visit are three: (i) a new
scientific publication led by a Masters student; (ii) new numerical
simulations that will make use of the new HPC facilities at Uniandes
and (iii) one month summer course on theoretical and computational aspects of
cosmology.

\section{Invited Researchers}

{\bf Prof Yehuda Hoffman}. Professor

\section{Activities during the Sanford Chair period}

We plan the visit of Prof. Hoffman and Dr. Gottloeber to last one
month, starting on June 1st 2015 and finishing ond June 30th 2015. 

\subsection{Research}

The research activities  will be focused on two areas: the 
numerical modeling of the Local Universe on cosmological scales and
the automatized description of the filamentary large scale structure of the
Universe. This are main lines of my research as presented in my FAPA
(Fondo de Asistencia a Profesores Asistentes) project. 

Our joint collaboration on these subjects started in 2009 and has
been presented in 5 refereed publications since then. For this visit
we have two specific objectives
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Finish a publication} on the nature of the associations of Dwarf
Associations in the Local Volume. This will involve Juan Nicolas
Garavito, a Physics masters student at Uniandes.
\item {\bf Launch large numerical simulations} for constrained realization
of the Local universe. This will make use of the new HPC facility at Uniandes.
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Teaching}


The teaching activities will be focused in offering a summer course on
the theoretical, computational and observational aspects of cosmology
as studied with large scale structures in the Universe. This course
will have {\bf 80 teaching blocks of 45 minutes each} so it can be
offered as a 3 credit course to students in the Physics Department. 


Prof. Hoffman will teach 20 blocks on theoretical aspects
of physical cosmology and Dr. Gottl\"ober will teach 20 blocks on
different aspects of computational cosmology. The remaining 20
blocks will be led by Prof. Forero-Romero as hands-on sessions to practice on
the theoretical and computational aspects. This part will be offered
as small research projects that should be tackled during the last two
weeks of the Summer Course; Prof. Hoffman and Dr. Gottloeber will also
be available to assist the students.

We will open this course to physics students in the whole country,
with a limit of 25 participants, giving priority to Uniandes
students. No fee will be charged. Only ive travel fellowships will be
offered to students from outside Bogot\'a. 

We expect to follow the following schedule

\begin{itemize}
\item{First week: 20 blocks on theoretical aspects of physical
  cosmology by Prof. Hoffman}
\item{Second week: 20 blocks on computational cosmology by
  Dr. Gottloeber.}
\item{Third week: 20 blocks as hands-on practice for the research
  projects. Focus on how to use the HPC facilities at Uniandes. Led by
  Prof. Forero-Romero.} 
\item{Fourth week: 20 blocks as hands-on practice for the research
  projects. Led by Prof. Forero-Romero.}
\end{itemize}

This school will require one research assistant for the hands on
sessions. 

\section{Budget}



\begin{tabular}{lll}\hline
Description & Item Cost & Total Cost \\\hline
Hotel for Prof. Hoffman & 80USD/night & 2400 USD\\
Hotel for Dr. Gottl\"ober & 80USD/night & 2400 USD\\
Per diem for Prof. Hoffman & 50USD  & 1500 USD\\
Per diem for Dr. Gottloeber & 50USD & 1500 USD \\
Airfare from TelAviv (Prof. Hoffman) & 1400 USD & 1500 USD\\
Airfare from Berlin (Dr. Gottlober) & 1400 USD & 1500 USD\\
Travel grants for students & 200 USD & 1000 USD\\\hline
 & {\bf Total} & 11800 USD\\\hline
\end{tabular}

\vspace{1cm}

The Sanford Chair fund provides 8000USD that could cover the hotel and
per diem expenses for Prof. Hoffman and Dr. Gottlober. The remaining
4000 USD for travel expenses will be covered from the FAPA grant of
Prof. Forero-Romero. 



Naturally, before the school we will look for external funding
possibilities (DAAD, ICETEX, COLCIENCIAS) to cover the travel costs
and offer financial support to the students attending the school.
